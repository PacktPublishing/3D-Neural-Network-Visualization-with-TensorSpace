# 3D Neural Network Visualization with TensorSpace [Video]
This is the code repository for [3D Neural Network Visualization with TensorSpace [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/3d-neural-network-visualization-tensorspace-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781838642105), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
TensorSpace is a neural network 3D visualization framework built by TensorFlow.js, Three.js and Tween.js. TensorSpace provides Keras-like APIs to build deep learning layers, load pre-trained models, and generate a 3D visualization in the browser. By applying TensorSpace API, it is more intuitive to visualize and understand any pre-trained models built by TensorFlow, Keras, TensorFlow.js, etc.

In this quick and short course, you will learn how to present the inner workings of your pre-trained Neural Network models with an easy-to-access 3D visualizations in a web browser. By the end of this course, you will be able to create compelling 3D visualizations that will show your neural network architecture and even how your pre-trained models work in the real-time with TensorSpace
